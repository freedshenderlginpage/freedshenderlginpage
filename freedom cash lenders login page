In general, the fee at these check-cashing stores is around $4 for each $100. This may not sound like much, but it is when compared with the alternatives. A bank or credit union account should offer you free check cashing services. If you haven’t had time to open a bank account and need to cash a small, personal check, see if your base has a military exchange that will cash your check for free.

Many off-base check-cashing stores also make “payday loans” to military personnel and other individuals who work full time. These are dangerous propositions best avoided; they typically bring high interest rates and high fees. They are akin to folding $100 bills into paper airplanes and throwing them out a second-floor window.

The federal government had limited these loan interest rates to 36%, but in 2018 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stopped enforcing that limit. That rule was reversed in June of 2021.

In July of 2021 a group of 188 civil rights and consumer groups signed a letter to Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, Chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The letter called for the cap – which at 36% is scary enough — to be reinstated permanently.

The letter states without the cap lenders are charging in the triple digits for interest rates. When an individual can’t repay the loan, he or she gets trapped in a cycle of borrowing at ridiculous rates, meaning 80% of any payment on a payday loan goes to the interest on the loan. The loan goes on, seemingly forever.
