Moving is never fun, and some find it’s costly to move appliances. It may be wise to donate an older TV or washing machine to a charity rather than pay to have it shipped.

How to replace it? Rent-to-own! You agree to pay a weekly rental fee and, in time, you’ll own the TV or appliance. Just be warned: This is an expensive way to buy an item.

Let’s say you see the TV at a department store and it costs $400, but you don’t have that much cash. Instead, you agree to a rent-to-own plan for the same TV. For $15.95 a week, you’ll have the TV you want, and in 78 weeks, you’ll own the TV.

Sound appealing? It’s not. Not when you break down the numbers:

    Weekly Rental: $15.95 x 78 weeks = $1,244.10
    5% Sales Tax: 80¢ x 78 weeks = $62.40

Your $400 TV winds up costing $1,306.50.

A better option would be to buy a used TV or save your money until you have the $400.
